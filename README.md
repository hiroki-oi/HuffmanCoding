# HuffmanCoding
Huffman coding using binary heap
***
Implemented Huffman coding using STL  
Hope you can use it if you copy other than main.cpp
***
## Usage
The symbol type is defined in HuffmanNode.hpp.  
Use unsigned char for 1 byte and unsigned short for 2 bytes.  
If you throw a std::vector it will probably work.
